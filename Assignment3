<div class="main">Wikipedia is a website that contains millions of pages, each focused on a different topic, in a wide variety of languages. Created by Wikimedia Foundation, it is essentially an online encyclopaedia, hence the name 'Wikipedia.' One unique thing about Wikipedia is that anyone can update it at any time, meaning that the information stays pretty up to date, rather than a physical encyclopaedia that needs to be re-released whenever information gets updated. It also links sources to the information found on its pages, allowing readers to both fact-check the information they read and have a starting point for if they wish to do further research on whatever they are reading about.<br/>
<br>I use Wikipedia because I am a naturally curious person, and I like to learn about new things.<br/>
